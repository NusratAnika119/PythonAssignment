# PythonAssignment
a Python program that asks the user to enter the names of three students and their marks in three subjects. The program should then display each student’s name, their marks, their average score, and whether they have passed or failed based on their average.

# How it works:

The program asks for each student’s name and marks in 3 subjects.

1. It calculates the average of the marks.

2. If the average is 40 or above, the student passes; otherwise, they fail.

3. Finally, it displays all the details neatly.
